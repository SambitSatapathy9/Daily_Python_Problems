Problem 3 (26.06.2023)
## Problem Statement - Write a Python program to check whether a given number is prime
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num ==1:
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number")
elif num > 1:
    #check for factors
    for i in range(2,num):
        if(num % i) == 0:
            print(f"{num} is not a prime number")
            print(f"{i} X {num//i} is {num}")
            break
    else:
        print(f"{num} is a prime number")
           
else:
    #if input is negative number
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number")
